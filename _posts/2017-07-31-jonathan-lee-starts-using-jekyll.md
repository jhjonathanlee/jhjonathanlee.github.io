It took me a while, but I've finally set up my own personal website on github. I'm using Jekyll to generate the site (these blog posts included!) following this guide: http://jmcglone.com/guides/github-pages/. No doubt I'll be adding my personal flavour to it soon enough. Also looking forward to having tons of interesting content for my readers (current population: me).
